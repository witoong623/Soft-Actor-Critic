Using tanh and mse
- image kind of blurly regardless of the size of dataset. I used mse with reduction = "mean" though.
- mse with reduction = "sum" give the best result of VAE so far

Using sigmoid and binary cross entropy
- I uses some flip augmentations, result is the worst I ever seen, I used reduction = "mean" though.
- BCE with reduction = "sum" gave the same result as the model I used before.
